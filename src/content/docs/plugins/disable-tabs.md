title: Disable Tabs
description: Ensure opening any new tab replaces the current one only.

[Disable Tabs](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-disable-tabs) is off by default, but if enabled, opening any new tab replaces the current one only. 

This is especially useful when you're hiding the tab bar and don't want multiple tabs cluttering your workspace. If you enable this, you might consider adjusting [UI Tweaker](/plugins/ui-tweaker/) settings under the Hider > Navigation section.
