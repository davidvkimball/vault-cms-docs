description: Automating content creation and slug management.
---

[Astro Composer](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-astro-composer) is handy for easily creating new notes as Astro content like blog posts or pages. 

Just create a new note with `CTRL + N`, type in a title in Title case or with special characters, and the note or folder name generated is a kebab-case version of the title without special characters. This is ideal for automating content page slugs. 

You can also define and set default properties that can be generated automatically or manually. The "Standardize properties" command can help set or reorganize any missing properties or tags.

### Commands
- **Open terminal**: Modified for Windows, macOS, and Linux to start terminal in the relevant directory. Activate with `CTRL + SHIFT + D`. 
- **Edit Astro config**: Opens your `astro.config.mjs` or `config.ts` file. Activate with `CTRL + SHIFT + ,`.
- **Convert internal links**: Convert Obsidian links to Astro-compatible links.
