[Property Over File Name](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-property-over-file-name) lets you use the `title` property as its primary label instead of its file name when linking, searching, or displaying notes.

Using title properties is more helpful visually and semantically since note file names are actually page slugs in kebab case. 

When you link to another note, its `title` is automatically set as the hyperlinked text. Tabs also display the note's `title` property instead of the file name.
