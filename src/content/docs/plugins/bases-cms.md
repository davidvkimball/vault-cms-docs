description: Managing your content with a grid-based interface.

[Bases CMS](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-bases-cms) lets us treat a grid of content like a content management system. 

You can select multiple items and do bulk edits, rename content right from that view, or toggle the draft status of an item. You're also able to configure the CMS view and even add new views to your liking. 

Bases CMS works together with [Home Base](/plugins/home-base/) to provide a directory of all your content.
