[Alias File Name History](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-alias-filename-history) helps you keep track of old post or page URLs if you rename your files.

`CTRL + R` allows you to easily rename blog posts, and note filenames (or parent folders) get updated in kebab-case automatically. When this happens, the old filename will be stored as an alias by default. 

You can adjust settings for tracking file aliases, including regex for ignoring specific names (like `Untitled` or a `_` prefix), timeout in seconds, or tracking changes in the parent folder name.
