[Vault CMS](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-vault-cms) is the core plugin that coordinates the experience. When you start Vault CMS, a wizard will pop up guiding you through configuring Obsidian to work with your Astro theme. 

If something seems off during the process, ensure you have copied the vault folder to a location within your Astro project (usually `src/content`).

Once configured, your setup is ready to go. Just restart Obsidian and start at [Home Base](/plugins/home-base/).
