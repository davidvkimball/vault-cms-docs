[UI Tweaker](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-ui-tweaker) lets you hide and adjust UI elements to your liking. Open it up and customize your interface to remove distractions or rearrange elements.

Should you desire to hide any of the panels, you can use the following hotkeys (configured by default):
- Left side panel: `CTRL + ALT + Z`
- Right side panel: `CTRL + ALT + X`
- Tab bar: `CTRL + ALT + S`

Pressing the hotkey again will reveal the panel.
