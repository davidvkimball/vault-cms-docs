description: Simplify your file explorer view for folder-based content.
---

[Folder Notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes) is off by default, but is an option for anyone using a folder-based system of content who might want to simplify their file explorer view. 

Instead of hunting down the `index.md` or similar file in each folder, each parent folder assumes the name of the content housed within it, and the Markdown file can be opened by simply clicking the folder itself.
