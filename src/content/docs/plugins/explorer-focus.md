description: Simplify your file explorer view to the relevant directory.

With [Explorer Focus](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-explorer-focus), you can simplify your file explorer view to just the directory that's immediately relevant to your currently-open file. 

Just click the toggle focus button or right-click a directory in the file explorer pane to pare down on the number of files and folders you're seeing, helping you stay focused on your current project.
