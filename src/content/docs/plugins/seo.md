The [SEO](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-seo) plugin provides a snappy audit of your content for search engine rankings and AI parsing. 

You can get a quick snapshot of your whole vault or drill down into specific posts. You can configure the settings to turn off checks you don't care about or tweak the logic in the calculations.
