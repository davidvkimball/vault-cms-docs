[Editing Toolbar](https://github.com/PKM-er/obsidian-editing-toolbar) adds a WYSIWYG toolbar to Obsidian. 

Click the "toggle editing toolbar" button (added with [UI Tweaker](/guides/theme-and-ui/)) on the title bar to show or hide it. It's hidden until revealed and completely disabled on mobile by default.
