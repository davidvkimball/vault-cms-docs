[Image Manager](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-image-manager) allows you to quickly drag and drop image files, insert images with a command, or paste images directly from your clipboard. 

Pull in images from Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay easily with just a few keystrokes. Just use `CTRL + '` to insert a remote image and immediately set SEO-friendly alt text and a file name. Insert into the designated property with `CTRL + SHIFT + '`.

You can also add a nice-looking banner on the top of any Markdown file as long as a valid `image` property is defined. This matches the cover image used in the [Bases CMS](/plugins/bases-cms/) view by default.
