description: Set your default screen to a directory of all your content.

[Home Base](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-home-base) works together with [Bases CMS](/plugins/bases-cms/) so your default screen is a `.base` file that's a directory of all of your content, listed in reverse-chronological order. 

A home icon is pinned to your tab bar, which makes it easy to return to. You can turn this off if you'd like in Home Base's settings.
