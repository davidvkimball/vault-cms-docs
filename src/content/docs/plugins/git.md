With the [Git](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-git) plugin, you can easily publish to your Astro blog without leaving Obsidian. Simply configure with git to enable it. 

By default, you'll see your current git status and count of files changed in the status bar on the bottom right. To publish, use `CTRL + SHIFT + S` or click the "commit-and-sync" button. Your changes will be committed and pushed to your remote repository automatically.
