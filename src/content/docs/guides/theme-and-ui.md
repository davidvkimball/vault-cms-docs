## Oxygen Theme

The visual identity of Vault CMS is built on the [Oxygen](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-oxygen) theme, which is based on the [Minimal theme system](https://minimal.guide/home). It provides a slick, highly customizable color scheme designed for long-form writing and content management.

For granular control over the theme, the [Oxygen Theme Settings](https://github.com/davidvkimball/obsidian-oxygen-settings) plugin is installed by default. This allows you to define your own color scheme presets and adjust the visual experience to your exact preferences.

## UI Plugins

In addition to the theme, several plugins work together to create a focused and efficient user interface:

- [UI Tweaker](/plugins/ui-tweaker/): Hide and adjust specific UI elements.
- [Explorer Focus](/plugins/explorer-focus/): Keep your file tree clean and relevant.
- [Zen Mode](/plugins/zen-mode/): Remove all distractions for a pure writing experience.
- [Editing Toolbar](/plugins/editing-toolbar/): A WYSIWYG toolbar for easier formatting.

If you desire even more control, you can install the [Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) plugin to unlock further customization options within Oxygen.
