title: Introduction
description: Overview, philosophy, and default settings for Vault CMS.
---

All plugins, key bindings, and the theme can be customized to your liking, but this is what's on by default.

## Philosophy 

1. **Plug-and-play Astro blogging experience**: Designed to work out of the box with your Astro project.
2. **Emphasis on customization and modularity**: Every part of the system is replaceable or adjustable.
3. **Visual parity between backend and frontend**: What you see in Obsidian should closely match what your readers see.

## Default Settings

1. Markdown links are used in favor of wikilinks.
2. Some core plugins are disabled (details below).
3. Indentation guides have been disabled.
4. Inline title has been hidden to prioritize the `title` property via [Property Over File Name](/plugins/property-over-file-name/).
5. Custom [hotkeys](/guides/vault-hotkeys/) have been set.
6. Community plugins have been enabled to enhance the [Astro](/plugins/astro-composer/) workflow.
